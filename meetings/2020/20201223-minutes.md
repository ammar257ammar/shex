# ShEx CG Meeting 23-12-2020


*Sam: algebraic properpropertyty graphs schemas: 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@underlay/apg 
*anastasia: fixing lighthouse
*nishad: ginja templates to convert YAML to ShEx
*John: DCMI new format for DC Application Profiles- John presented ShEx Statements
**CSV2ShEx: https://csv2shex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/About.html
**ShEx Statements: https://shexstatements.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs.html
*ericP: are you talking about the same subset of ShEx?
*John: ShEx-Lite: https://github.com/weso/shex-lite

## ShEx Subsetting
*[ericP describes subsetting]

*If I think a schema is useful, a good partition of WD, I can create a nice label for it and indicate how it's useful, to save it
--> entity schema for validation linked to the definition of a subset. 
*(Think of subsetting as a way to partition WD)
*Q: is the space.of useful subsets similar to the space of  recurring entity schemas, or to the space of recurring queries? Are these the same rough scale?
*(Kat notes the EntirySchema: namespace)



## Lightweight Shapes

*Kat: [reads [scidude's question](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_Schemas#lightweight_Shapes)]
*Editor SciDude's question: " Let's talk a real example: I have a list of 1.6M entities and a list of shapes; the task is to provide, for each shape, a list of items out of the 1.6M that are valid for each shape, and the result should not be older than 24 hours since the full WD dump download. Bonus if it can be done on a quad-core desktop with 32G of RAM." List of shapes: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Molecular_biology/ShEx

... Vladimir pointed out that currently all implementations are set up to do validation in memory.
... Labra wanted to prototype not working from memory.
*ericP: HDT and quiet validation
*John: has anyone tried to dump Wikidata and validate? mostly folks use shex.js
*ericP: not yet, but could do

## ShapePaths
*ericP: Use case- we had a webid schema, but also has annotations that indicate how we want to lay out a form generated from the schema. Some parts of the form behave differently based on the annotations. Then we asked why would we want to annotate the shema- which is used by a lot of people- keep schema minimal, use aux document to store annotations. We came up with ShapePaths that allows you to access parts of the schema. Resolves paths, sticks annotations on, and then generates the form. Question is, what should this language look like? 
Labra and ericP and Iovka have been discussing how the language should look. 
Also used in ShapeTrees- we want to say i want to give someone access to this condition and everything associated with this condition- schema has ShapePaths in it to find resources related to a condition. Allows you to annotate schema with things that say if you are validating and something matches this then it is something you want to change the access permissions for.
A way to have SPARQL like queries for 
The expressivity of ShapePaths- since shapes can be complex- there is a lot of XPath like indexing.
Still working on test suites, still designing the language.
*Anastasiia: Seems related to my problems in Lighthouse- translations- as labels, add translations of labels to our shapes.
*ericP: ShapePaths gives you a tailored way to navigate a schema- that allows you to navigate tersely- could use JSONPaths on the ShExJ. Would be much more verbose. ShapePaths intended to be terse and tailored to specific structure.
