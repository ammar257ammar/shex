## Minutes
  
Chair: Andra
Attendees: Nishad, Kat, Eric, John, Tom
Regrets:

### community updates
* Eric works on C parser for ShEx
* John is working on ShEx statements: https://github.com/johnsamuelwrites/ShExStatements
* Harold has been working with Dan Brickley using ShEx in website parsing
* Andra working on Wikibases and Gene wiki

Karen: DCMI IG working on very simple profile written in ShEx. 
... when defining a property we want to say it could be an IRI or a LITERAL

Eric: Turning a table into ShEx - two scenarios:
* Data is in table, [validate] using ShEx.
* I want to represent a schema as tables and translate into ShEx

John: Started with proof of concept. My grammar is ready - could share example.

Karen: Target audience: people who create simple profiles without writing ShEx.

Andra: rule-based checker for the CSV. You could embed the checker into the CSV-to-ShEx parser. Table-to-ShEx, then look at validation of ShEx coming out of the serializer.

Karen: Haven't figured out where to put the prefixes in the CSV.

Nishad: If we define in CSV, should be standard CSV unless we [extend]. If we stick to standard, can use standard library. Would have to write parser from scratch. Barrier to adoption.  For example, want to load into Jupyter notebook.  Current format is good - can directly load into Open Refine, etc.  Otherwise, treat as language and make grammar and parser.

Andra: But then you are limiting yourself - 

Eric: ShEx Lite - things easily expressible in tables.  Designed to capture things expressible in tables.  Nice thing about having ShEx Lite: If your expressivity exceeds that, you can simply edit the resulting ShEx.

Andra: Can this align with ShEx statements?  You have Quick Statements in Wikidata - ShEx statements uses a similar format, for wikidata.

John: Inspired by Tom's work - taking Wikidata statement. Let's take CSV statement and generate ShEx statements.
