### RESTRICTS and EXTENDS

* ericP: If I were to extend a shape that is a restriction of another shape- 
solution is when you are extending a shape, you look at each shape you're extending- some partition in your shape will match to that- originally was going to paste the restriction in- 

### Community Updates

* TomB: At AGROVOC last week (one of the driving use cases for SKOS). Andra joined and talked about Wikidata/ShEx. Lots of interest as FAO in Wikidata and ShEx. Follow up with Lynn Schriml and Lydia Pintscher.
* ericP: what's it mean to align with Wikidata?
* TomB: probably start by aligning the 3500 terms with Wikidata. Analogous to Disease Ontology, but DO also wants to assert DO arcs between Wikidata entities.
* kat: Tom have you seen: http://coli-conc.gbv.de/concordances/wikidata/
* andra: meeting with Diego tomorrow in brussels. should we touch base on doucumentation of the DIEGO model.
