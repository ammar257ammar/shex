### Action Items from last meeting



###  Pending actions to reply to Peter's report
 * Jeremie: Iovka said spec is ready, needs to do another pass, she believes it's good to go. Made a [1st draft of the algorithm](https://iovka.github.io/spec/algorithms)([diff](https://github.com/shexSpec/spec/compare/gh-pages...iovka:gh-pages)) in the repository in html, this is not ready yet but will be soon.
 * ... should we first write the algorithm or respond to peter first
 * Eric: We should ask peter what he prefers
 * ... propose we accept all changes to index.html

**PROPOSED**: merge Iovka's changes to https://github.com/iovka/spec as soon as she creates a PR.
* eric: +1
* Jérémie: +1
* Dimitris: +1

### Community Updates 

#### ShEx.js benchmarking demo 
[see here for details](https://gitter.im/shapeExpressions/Lobby?at=5afb02455a1d895fae40700a)
* Eric: I threw things to see how long it would take for each element in a shame map and the whole run. Whole run is longer because of browser constraints

#### Atom ShEx Plugin
[link](https://github.com/labra/language-shexc)
* Eric: Atom is a js library that can create an editor in the browser that we can use.

#### ShEx-to-UML converter
[link](http://rdfshape.weso.es/schemaInfo?schemaURL=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FSuLab%2FGenewiki-ShEx%2Fmaster%2Fproteins%2FWikidata-human-proteins.shex&schemaFormat=ShExC&schemaEngine=ShEx) (in progress)
* Eric: uses graphvis to render a schema where a shape has a bunch of properties. Not sure if it can deal with complex expressions. simple `eachOF` should be captured but more complex ones probably not. Not know OCL enough 
* ... the other interesting part is representatin of shape expressions might be undoable in UML. Typically, UML users with need for greater expressivity will create fake properties to capture relationships. It might be possible to do the same.

#### [Talk using ShEx](https://figshare.com/articles/Introducing_federated_queries_with_Wikidata/6287144) by Andra

* Andra: gave a talk to europeanna tech last week. Did not do a lot of shex hands-on but had a 2 hour session.
* 
#### Andra giving a talk @ Figshare Belgium
*  [FigshareFest](https://www.evensi.be/figshare-fest-belgium-2018-vrije-universiteit-brussel-building/255963513)
*  Would anyone use figshare to host/share Figshare?

#### Swiss Bioinformatics Institute
* Andra: these folks are producing ShEx.
* ... ericP and I discussed how organize ShEx repos.
* ... I prototyped this using submodules of [shexSpec/schemas](https://github.com/shexSpec/schemas/tree/master/Wikidata) 
    * In this example Genewiki-ShEx @ c1d88be points to [SuLab/Genewiki-ShEx](https://github.com/SuLab/Genewiki-ShEx) 
* Do folks think this is a good organization?

#### Tom and Eric gave a DCMI webinar
[link](https://github.com/shexSpec/talks/blob/gh-pages/2018/04-10-kimworkshop-tombaker/ShEx.pdf)
* Tom: talk into the void with no feedback.
* ... the publicity machine was broken so the attendance was lower than expected.
* ... the webinar will be available on the DCMI youtube channel.
* ... it's all in PowerPoint in the [shexSpec:talks] repo.
* ... I added it via large-file-support which pushes the data to an external data server.
* ... you need to install `git-lfs.github.com` to get it to automagically dereference the links to big documents.

#### Request for ShEx tutorial or workshop @ [SWIB18](http://swib.org/swib18/) - Semantic Web in Libraries, Bonn, November 26
* Tom: got a request from the SWIB organizers for a tutorial at a Semantic Web and Libraries conf.
* ... SWIB likes to have half-day events where folks bring their laptops, install stuff and test it out.
* ... it would be a good way to meet the most innovative folks working in the Library space in Europe (and US). quite an international community.
* ... 90 min drive from Andra's house.
* ... Andra's guessing that Kat will attend.
* ... could have a big impact in that space.
* ... If libraries have a chance of remaining relevent, it's because of the attendees of this conference.
* ... picturing a half-day, hands-on tutorial.
* ... would also plug a gap in our docs which assume you know how to use e.g. java, python, scala, etc. in order to use the native tools.
* ericP: I've done this in the past (RDF tutorials) with multiple toolsets. This incented tool custodians to unify their interfaces, which was good for user experience.
* Andra: will the ERC ShEx work be relevent?
*
