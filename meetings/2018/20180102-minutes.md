## Constraint weights / severities for ShEx

* ericP: y'all have use cases?
* Kat: not yet
* Andra: seems useful but not yet

* ericP: proposals:
    Gregg: in language
    Dimitris: preprocessing step
My proposed syntax could probably be reallized either way.
One diff/issue would be whether/how severities show up in JSON-LD syntax, i.e. can we round-trip them?

tabling pending further consideration (doing nothing)

## Discuss dataset support

* [ericP summarizes #77]

* Andra: consider Wikidata as a central hub, built on blazegraph and key/value pairs exported as RDF.
... you have more granular data stored on another pair of blazegraph and key/value store.

* ericP: interesting, introduced federation instead of just GRAPH

* Andra: indeed, though you can implement this as a monolothic graph

* ericP: is there any difference between requirements for GRAPH vs. requirements for SERVICE?

* Andra: a SERVICE could be seen as just a graph.

* ericP: We've got the multiple datasets example- rather than multiple blazegraph/wikibase instances, we had them all in one blazegraph/wikibase- what transforms to go to node name to graph name?

* Andra: Wikidata is not a good use case here. 

* ericP: FHIR use case: patients are stored in individual graphs. FHIR system works by saying couple hundred resource types. All have their own resource names, either shove into one database, or since they are gettable via node name, or stick them in named graph, each instance of a resource with a principle named node- then there is no identity transformation. Node of interest be graphname#it, this way of being rigorous has a textual transformation as well. We typically are going from nade name to graph name. If these graph names are addressable via HTTP they can't have fragments. 

* Andra: Maybe HealthTrain?

* ericP: I think HealthTrain will be like FHIR.

* Andra: Validation that will go upstream, such as Flybase, since Wikidata is a cache.

* ericP: Does schema need to include info about where a shape should get vaildated- or is that better as system configuration. Service requirements that would inform how we do graphs.

* ericP: I will work this from the HealthTrain perspective. I'll do an implementation of what I described in the issue.
