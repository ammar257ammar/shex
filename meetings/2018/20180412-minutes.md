### Graph constraints

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/77

* ericP: [introduce graph/node transformations]
* Gregg: verifiable claims: the claim is in its own graph
 ... in JSON-LD, a named graph is introduced by an object that has an @graph keyword
 ... so if that object is the value, that means that the graph name is an object in a triple in some other graph.
 ... but that doesn't state a starting point in the named graph.
 ... so we probably need a way to re-use the shapemap.
* ericP: [channeling harold]: we don't want to reproduce shapemap in shex without serious consideration
 ... it seems we need a triplepattern queryMap
* Gregg: we need to add a column in the shape map [...]
* ericP: The validitiy [...writing & explaining example below...]

```
<cred1> vc:claim _:claim2
GRAPH _:claim2 {
  did:cliam2s :ageOver 21
}
```
```
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
  "@id": "cred1",
  "claim": {
    "id": "did:claim2s",
    "ageOver": 21
  }
}
```
```
<credShape> {
  vc:claim @<ClaimShape>
}
<ClaimShape> GRAPH REFEREE FOCUS=?x {
  :ageOver xsd:integer
}
```
``` ShapeMap
<cred1>@<credShape>,
{FOCUS :ageOver _}=?x@<ClaimShape>
```


* Gregg: start matching something with a vc:claim.

### Requirement non recursive shapeExprRef #19

* EricP: I can rearrange the spec to make the diff easier to view
* Jeremie: I put the laster version in the lobby: https://github.com/iovka/spec
  ... was on holidays, working on a small extension with Iovka
* EricP: create anextension API 

### Community updates

* Preprint of the paper we submitted to ISWC: https://zenodo.org/record/1214521#.Ws9KT5ch2Uk
* Citable version of PyShEx: https://zenodo.org/record/1214189#.Ws9Kopch2Uk
* Citable version of SHACLex: https://zenodo.org/record/1214239#.Ws9KpZch2Uk
* Citable version of shex.js: https://zenodo.org/record/1213693#.Ws9LKZch2Uk

* Kat: created a preprint for the ISWC submission
  ... entailed creating three citable versions.

#### ShEx tutorial
* Tom: will gave a ShEx tutorial on librarians and developers. We did this last year and was well-recieved and we want to do again this year.
 ... people interested in differences between json schema and shex
 ... if we can put ShEx in Jupiter notebooks we will open up ShEx in data scientists or in workshop
 ... a lot hapenning in that area, we could even do the ShEx primer as a Jupiter notebook
* ericP: talk to people who develop this 

### Support multiline comments

ACTION: ericP to update grammars and close issue

### Issue on mismatches in ShExC & ShExJ in spec
https://github.com/shexSpec/spec/issues/22

* ericP: not worried about conversion between different serializations, probably typos
