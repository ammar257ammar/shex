### Community updates

#### Tutorials
* abstract for the ShEx workshop at SWIB 2018 [http://swib.org/swib18/programme.html#abs07](https://)
    * Tom, Andra and Kat will be faciliting this tutorial. 

* Still room for a tutorial submission about ShEx about SWAT4LS This would be the third ShEx tutorial there, this is the issue of how to make a ShEx tutorial germane for people who have already attended one. Integrate this with the contribution from accepted talks. 
* Andra: the Agro folks are new to the SWAT4LS community. Can we extend the ShEx tutorial to introduce the AgriSemantics schemas.
* Harold: AgriVoc folks?
* Andra: yes
* Tom: There's an AgriSemantics initiative. It's not really funded but some orgs are trying to get some momentum around it. FAO, INRA (National Agricultural Institute of France - Institut national de la recherche agronomique), CGIAR (a consortium of agronomic institutes represented by Medha Devare, who will give a keynote), CABI (UK agricultural center), USDA. Because it's not really funded, folks have only been meeting at other meetings e.g. RDA.
* Harold: Changed affiliations to Johns Hopkins. JHU will be joining W3C shortly.
* TODO: Eric and Harold will write a proposal to SWAT4LS w/ assistance from Andra
* TODO: Kat will share collaborative document for workshop development with Harold, Andra, ericP, Tom so we can prep

#### [Wikidata ShEx Inference tool](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Lucas_Werkmeister/Wikidata_Shape_Expressions_Inference) announced [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_ShEx#Wikidata_ShEx_Inference_tool). 

* Lucas: I have built a tool available to everyone. You go to the tool website and enter a SPARQL query, it will fetch data. After some time (10min - 2hours), in return you get Shape Expressions. 
* Lucas: I am working on the next step of using that expressions in validation
* Lucas: Feedback in the next two weeks would be appreciated in the context of thesis deadline. 
* Eric: There is a tool by Jesse van Dam. 
* Lucas: Yes it is based on that one (RDF2Graph). 
* Andra: I could create a WikiData item and a SPARQL query that would select an item? Our current model invovles selecting a canonical example data. Does that story work with your bot?
* Lucas: Since it will take the items that are referenced, it might not be as clean as you'd expect. I've been working with with Q42 and it brings in an enormous amount of garbage.
* Andra: can you use [Reelin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13561329)  as a use case?
* Lucas: sure ([job #6](https://tools.wmflabs.org/wd-shex-infer/job/6)).
* ericP: Trying to get spec up to date for release. Worked through deltas between antlr and spec grammars.
* Harold: Still an outstanding issue with SPARQL
* ericP: I worked out that it is related to in order to keep semantics simple in shex 2.0 a production label could not just point to another production label. I had to do NOTS or shapeAnds to reference another production label.
* ericP: We may be able to take away that constraint. I have to ask Iovka about it.

### Discuss features to take on v2.1

ACTION: Dimitris to write to pfps to say that the evaluation semantics have been rewritten and are ready for review and that there will be concurrent updates to the grammar as we merge change for e.g. long comments, language tag round-tripping, annotations/semActs on NodeConstraints, etc.

Kat will track down all resolutions made in meeting minutes since July 2017
