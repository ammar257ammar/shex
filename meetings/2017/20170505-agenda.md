We have a flurry of activity on the API. This raises issues like:
  * who do we expect to implement the API?
  * how faithfully should they do so?
  * will REST interfaces reflect the programmar's API?
  * do we need a serialization for ShapeMaps?

These are captured below under \[Open Issues\] but there may be a better narrative to help us consider and discuss them. Ideas?
