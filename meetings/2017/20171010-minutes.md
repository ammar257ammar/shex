## Pending actions

About: Tom to follow up with EricP re: possible applicability of DCMI/FOAF agreement to ShEx.

 * Tom: will bring this to next board meeting
 * Eric: the idea is if I get run by a bus DCMI will take over
 * Tom: Also discuss this with Dan and both thought this was a good idea and DCMIis happy to do this is everyone in the ShEx community is up for it

About : Eric work on a prototype for extending shapes

 * Eric: no progress here

About: Eric fix the lang-tag issue

 * Eric: 2 pull requests ( 17 and 23), we alighed with SPARQL. Changed the text in the spec to follow RFC ??? and added related tests
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/pr-preview/shexSpec/spec/74d60b7...6b6331a.html#values
  https://github.com/shexSpec/shexTest/pull/23/commits/46c7f1a18711e063fbd199a98470a10af4d55658
Harold and Greg approved then and were merged

Issue 71 ended in 3 new issues: 
 - #74 start match any lang like `*` in SPARQL. rdf:langString would have the same behavor
 - #73 language incensitivity for e.g. `en-GB` is identical to `en-gb` but when we round trip it via ShExR we lose case. Semantics are the same

* Greg: roundtripping will always be problematic, we can accept this
* Dimitris: we write a proposal on the issue and people can vote offline

## Issue #72 https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/72
foo:status.good foo:status.bad
[foo:status.~]
[<http://...status.>~]

ASK { ?s foo:p1 foo:v1. ?s bar:p2 foo:v2. }
ASK { ?s foo:p1 foo:v1 . ?s bar:p2 foo:v2 . }

 * Greg: is there an expectation that we align with SPARQL
 * Eric: 
 * Grep: As long as there is some note that describes this in detail with warnings

PROPOSAL: Allow Trailing dots in prefixed names by changing the rule for PN_LOCAL to be: `<PN_LOCAL> ::= (PN_CHARS_U | ":" | [0-9] | PLX) (PN_CHARS | "." | ":" | PLX))?`

RESOLVED


## ShEx @ Wikidata conference
 * Eric: the wikidata hackathon seems to be the star of the XLDB conference. Due to sign-up, Andra will be joined by another wkidata person from Lyon.

## Discuss ShEx Ruby DSL (https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-shex/2017Oct/0000.html)
 * Gregg: This was brought up during a discussion with Tom about DCMI/DSP. Ruby allows to write DSL languages which is easy for people to understand and does not look so much as programming.
(...describing example from email...)
The advantage of this is that it is Ruby and there is no external parsing like e.g. from SeXC to the same Ruby structure
 * Eric: what I am wondering is the audience of this DSL is it only for Ruby people or general-purpose?
 * Gregg: there are advantages for people that use RUby for sure but also allows people to define schemas that are closer to natual language syntax. Karen spends a lot of time doing something like this for DSP
 * Tom: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-shex/2017Oct/0001.html - (... describinh the example from email ...)
 * Karen: wanted a way to have an easier transition from hign level overview to ShEx
 * Eric: how about a markdown parser to ShEx?
 * Karen: another aspect is the guidance aspect.  Dublin Core ethos: do the simple thing well.
 
Tom notes that Pandoc supports: pandoc -f html -t markdown http://www.fsf.org .
