IMPORT in Shex
  spec: https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/spec/import/index.html#import

Eric: added a link above to the IMPORT featured being implemented. The IMPORT that was implemented, is what Eric expected people want. e.g. Schema 1 has useful stuff, which can be used in schema 2.  Design decision that were taken. The product of the import are not complete schema descriptions. Only ShExC can do imports, ShExJ and ShExR can't. 
It should be a resolvable IRI, because it is the only thing testable. 

Examples: https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/spec/import/index.html#import
  
ShExC production for import: https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/spec/import/index.html#import

Eric wants input from us on if this is what is expected in importing on shapes.

Andra: will use this for variant use case.
... want to say that a variant conforms to someone else's shapes schema.
... possible that within an external group, folks may import conflicting schemas.
... org1: A imports B, C. B references C#S1. org2: A' imports B, C'. B now references C'#S1.

Eric: that would be an argument for B explicitly importing (the correct) C rather than counting on some A to import it.

EricP: I want to import Shape1 but change one of the triple expressions.
...We'd need a shape edit language (sed for ShEx) which could leverage triple expression labels.

Lars: I'd be reluctant to change triple expressions. It's like overloading in object-oriented programming.
...Q: is it about adding constraints vs. changing the behavior of existing shapes.
...e. g. one shapes mandates the use of LOC subject headings vs. another one re-using that shepe but reaquiring the use of the French RAMEAU
...Not sure I'd need that feature at all.
... I'd expect shapes to be modular. If you change stuff, it's no longer shape reuse.

ericP: if you have a start shape or start actions in an imported schema, the import fails. 

ericP: advice to editor/implementor?

Andra: need to use it. Also, Lucas and Kat intersted.

Lars: +1

Andra: what do IMPORTs do to error reports?

ericP: in my impl, you wouln't be able to tell whether a reference was resolved in your own schema or an imported schema.

PROPOSE: consider IMPORT as prototyped. await further implementation/use experience.
ericP: +1

Eric: THe question is what to work on now? 

Andra: property paths?

ericP: arguably leads to bad practice

Andra: GRAPH constraints?

ericP: I know JJC has some. I should ping him.

Andra: ShEx-to-dot converter?

ericP: maybe UML is a better target?

Andra: not much open-source UML

ericP: If we go for dot, we need to develop a dot flavours, which basically means reinventing UML.
 two issues:
     1. UML has a real bias towards relational data. It separates values from relations. 
    2 Can't write out choices. UML can't work with OR

Andra: emulate SBGN? http://sbgn.github.io/sbgn/ (System Biology Graphical Notation)

Example of a graphical notation: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:ProteinBoxBot/data_model/variants
