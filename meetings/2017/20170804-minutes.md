 * Dimitris: Let's talk about
#17, #31

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/17
https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/31

 * EricP: Lists- support from recursive shape- we used it in ShExR- we have a convention that says : triple expression list 2+- a list of triple expressions with at least 2 members in it.
If we dream up a syntax- new implementations would just have to add a little bit to their parser.
This would be a nice place to start- tansition from 2.0-2.1, and would demonstrate how we intend to build on 2.0 with backwards compatibility
Unique constraints- 2 flavors- 1 on a particular instance of a shape- everything wiht this node can have only 1 of xyz properties

 * Dimitris: Have you seen unique before?
 * Lucas: Unique in the whole graph vs. unique in this list
 * Dimitris: In SHACL- unique lang feature- can't have multiple tags 
 * EricP: Keyword 'focus'- this says the node that is being tested- if you don't have 'focus' then you are talking about the entire database- with 'focus' you are talking about a particular node
 * Dimitris: Trying to handle this in a general way would be good
 * EricP: For SHACL unique lang- for the focus node and the language tag of some prop, I have a unique- 

UNIQUE(FOCUS, language(rdfs:label))

 * EriP: if you take a away focus, this would apply across the database
 * Lucas: If you implement collections as a recursive shape, how do you express that something is unique across the full collection
 * EricP: That is a good question, it does not address that use case
 * Dimitris: ShEx doesn't have the notion of property path, maybe something special to traverse the list
 * EricP: The reason ShEx doesn't have prop oath- closed gets very confusing- but it doesn't mean we can't figure it out or add property paths- would take think work
Other situations where we want unique that goes over multiple nodes, but NOT the whole database?

One way would be to have prop path, or custom thing that says how to do it for collections, or some way to build a set and then apply unique to members of the set, RDF collection is one way to build a set.

Looking at relational databases and their use of unique might be a way to finding additional use cases

 * Dimitris: What about something like inverse fuctional property
 * EricP: unique without a focus- what semantics come out of IFP- 
 * Dimitris:In Wikidata,  Freebase ID- can't have 2 WD items with the same Freebase ID
 * EricP: not tied to a shape, across the whole database

UNIQUE(freebaseID)

That's a good use case, we should mock that up- there is a branch (accessors) in my implementation and also in ShEx Test- a start on building these- if we have the same prop multiple times in a shape, it is derving different roles, we can assign a label to the different roles. 

 * EricP: I will mock this up with property labels instead of accessor labels- we can look at the 2 approaches and see which makes sense
 * Kat: Could there be a set of all 
 * Dimitris: Unique per class- a social ID number must be unique per preson, but that number could occur somewhere else

```
<SoftwareItem> {
    :version [1.0 1.1 2.0]
}

<V11Item> &<SoftwareItem> {
    :version [1.1]
}

BOOLEAN: <V11Item> { :version [1.0 1.1 2.0] } AND { :version [1.1] }

HARD: <V21Item> &<SoftwareItem> { !! :version [2.1] }
```
If we focus on the Boolean version:
Everything it inherits from the parent will get inlcuded transitively - implemented in Fancy ShEx demo- line 77

https://www.w3.org/2013/ShEx/FancyShExDemo.html?schemaURL=test%2FIssue-inheritance%2Fschema.shex&dataURL=test%2FIssue-inheritance%2Fpass-user-employee.ttl&starting-nodes=%3CIssue1%3E&colorize=true

We could reproduce that functionality in ShEx 2.1

virtual means- "I don't want to hear that it matches this"

 * Dimitris- The word 'virtual' could be confusing
 * EricP: I'm open to suggestions on how to rename it
 * Dimitris: 'abstract'?
 * EricP: Abstract is better than virtual
