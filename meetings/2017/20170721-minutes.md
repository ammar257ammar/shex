 * Chair: Dimitris
 * Scribe:Kat

Agenda: https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/blob/master/meetings/20170721-agenda.md

Introductions:
    Alejandra and Philippe- Univ of Oxford, they are exploring ShEx and have some questions- looking at creating constraints on schemas- 
    Looked at JSON tech for some time. 
    Now converting to ShEx
    new to the tech.
    been working on semenatic dev for some time, but from the biological perspective.

Lucas: wikimedia germany, working on wikidata. masters thesis on inferring shapes from data.
Eric: Jesse worked on something similar (@ericP could you put a link please?)
Kat: interested to apply Shapes on a subset of Wikidata
Andra: member of GeneWiki team, using ShEx to model data, to test conformance before ingest into Wikidata, and to validate entity data in Wikidata

Dimitris: Main point is IDL- Gregg is not here today- we might not be able to make decisions, but we can have a discussion

ericP: We have 2 pubs, normatives specs- 1. shex semantics- negation and recursion paper accepted (good thing for ShEx to help demonstate it is sound) 2.shapemap- input into shex semantics- that document is expected to move faster than shex spec- infinite number of ways people we'd like to associate nodes and shapes
model for long tail of shapemap 
Primer- starts with intro and then a more detailed walk-thru
book due out in a week that talks about ShEx and SHACL
IDL next place for developing specs
The API goes into some of the details- but Harold Jose and Gregg aren't here-  
New version of shex spec and shapemap spec published last week
The Community Group pages points to all the latest versions of these documents

Dimitris: Other updates?
Discuss IDL or wait for the next meeting?

ericP: happy to wait

Andra: let's wait

ericP: Issue 47 and 4- I believe we can close 4
https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/4


https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/47
Partially complete- we will continue discussion

PROPOSE: close issue #4 as partially resolved by support of language tags is ShEx and track unique language tages in issue #47

Kat: +1
Andra: +1 
ericP: +1
Dimtiris: +1
Lucas: +1

RESOLVED!

ericP: I can go through 2.1 issues- 

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/48
extend the shape or import part of a schema from someplace else
import is a thorny issue- what to do with conflicts
extension- if you need to replace a constraint- you have to figure out the semanticis of replacement and how to do addressing- there is an accessor's branch- labes on triple expressions and triple patters- verbose

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/47
unique lang- unique constraints- powerful but expensive to implement- 
two flavors of unique- over all nodes i want to know these n props are functional- or for a node i want to know props are functional

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/37
If I want to say I have a long running validation- an dit will have results that are positive and negative- if i don't edit it it will stay true- that requires an ability to desclare a node does not match a shape

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/29
alllows for wildcard predicates- we can extend ShEx to support this functionality- 

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/24
value of width arc is less than height arc is possible in SHACL-


https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/17
triple expression 2+
makes sure you have at least 2 members in RDF collection

https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/16
Andra: yes this is backtick
ericP: Do we need to standardize this to become part of ShEx 2.1?
We should consider ourselves closed for features for 2.0


Dimitris: This is getting very technical
ericP: meta level- which of these are priorities to work on now

Dimitris: We have new people with use cases who might need to know if ShEx can meet their needs
ericP: Need interface
Is it worth doing extra markup so people can see it all together

Everyone who has opened an issue is requested to add a high-level statement about what use case

Dimitris: What questions remain after looking at website?

Alejandra: It is good to be aware of the open issues- Composition or inheritance is not yet supported
ericP: if you have use cases we need them
Alejandra: we have use cases and we will contribute to this discussion
We have been using JSON-LD and JSON schemas that we check against instance data
I saw on website that there is JSONLD syntax- it doesn't seem that it is JSONschema
ericp: shexj is not specified in terms of json schema it is rather specified to a grammar called ?

Alejandra: Comparisons in terms of expressivity? Are you aware of any formal comparisions between the 2?
ericP: no, i have wanted to do this for a while
piece of json happens to be jsonld, how can i validate it with json schema and how can i validate it with shex?
Alejandra: We are exploring expressivity options- I'm interested in such a comparison
ericP: are you a json schema expert?
Alejandra: I have been working with it a lot
ericP: I'd be happy to work with you on that
Alejandra: Status of python codebase?
ericP: scala and javascript rub are most up to date- the purest is the java implementation- but it is not yet finished- she has budget to pay for someone else to finish it- python harold and andra are working on that
Andra: yes, are you interested in a particular library
Andra: I will keep you posted on the developments
Alejandra: Inheritance of shapes is a priority for our use cases
ericP: we haven't figured out how to manage 2.1
Alejandra: Is there a plan to have a registry of shape expressions? 
ericP: The shemas repo is the closest thing right now, we could hve a markdown page or wikipage with links, descriptions, and contact info for creators
 https://github.com/shexSpec/schemas
 Andra: FAIR is also working to create a repository of shapes https://github.com/shexSpec/schemas/tree/master/FAIR
 Alejandra: who from FAIR?
 Andra: Leiden group
 Alejandra: does SHACL handle inheritance
 Dimitris: not shape inheritance but it does instance inheritance- and it is not rdfs inheritance
Dimitris: Semanitics workshop? Maybe Wikidata? Use case driven- tech provided through usecase
 
 Andra: For Wikidata I could think of a lot of examples
 
Andra: Ontology and ShEx? I think of it as - ontologies are about describing the world- shpaes are about the data that describes the world- in Wikidata- not describing gene itself, but rather the properties you would expect to be used to model data
