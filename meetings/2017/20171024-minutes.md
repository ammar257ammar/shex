## Pending actions

### Prototype for extending shapes

parser changes, but no checking support yet in shex.js(?)
no commits on that branch yet


### Round tripping language tags case #73

 * Eric: Initial language tag checks didn't care about hyphens that follows BCP 47. Vladimir files an issue and spec was updated and new test cases were created. Suggested we use BCP 47 and emmit it in normalized form

ShEx tutorial at WikidataCon:
    OpenCitation will demo how they use ShEx to validate
    Andra will demo GeneWiki usecase
    Engage with community: how should this be deployed in general?
    
Andra’s ShEx sublime package: https://github.com/andrawaag/Shex_Sublime_package (showcase gif: https://twitter.com/andrawaag/status/922560901693063170 )
    should facilitate community efforts (above)
    autocompletion for Wikidata, OBO and Schema.org
    plans for Jupyter kernel, but lots of work still to be done
    Tweet on sublime package: https://twitter.com/andrawaag/status/922560901693063170
    similar support for vim may be possible
    Q: is this specific to Wikidata? A: currently focused on the WikidataCon demo, but can be used elsewhere as well
    perhaps use this for in-browser editors as well (CodeMirror or Ace)


## Discuss Lars' primer feedback

 * Tom: some of the comments are straightforward but I have two deadlines this week to complete
 * Lars: happy to help if there is anything else I can do
 * Eric: can you do a PR
 * Lars: I could but is there anything else we can discuss before. Yes can do. Might split in 2-3 PR, one with the easy ones

## Discuss No way to say "any language-tagged string" #74: https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/74

 * Eric: add intuitive syntax @* to mean rdf:langString datatype
 * Andra: I like the idea of @*
 * should be ready by next meeting

Dimitris to send an email on the ShEx list

## Discuss ShEx DSL / ShEx embedding in documents
 * Greg: Tom, Karen and I will get together to discuss this in person next week
 * Tom: the issue is the gap with the compact syntax which is very readable but are also very technical between https://tombaker.github.io/shexpresent/toy#(4)
 
 Dimitris to check on Confluence requirements extraction
