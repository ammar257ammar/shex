* Egon: i don't think I've met Jeremie or Dimitris
* ... assistent professor at Mastrich. former colleage of Andra. using ShEx for BioSchemas and for chem info for Wikidata https://github.com/shexSpec/schemas/tree/master/Wikidata/chemistry
* ... is there a convention for when I create a new manifest.json file 
* vs. reusing a shared manifest.

* Kat: https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html

* ....: https://github.com/shexSpec/schemas/projects/1
* check for shex conformance feature

* Dimitris: might be interesting for validating open data like e.g. Wikidata http://bis.ue.poznan.pl/bis2019/qod/

# Email for Profiles Ontology review
* ericP: Talked to Ruben- http headers, content profile, use of shapes in the content profile- but this request to review was not about shex for content profiles- more about research management assertions about how profiles relate to one another
* Tom: I was asked to review PO.
* Eric: I think you and I (tom) have similar views on the PO. 
* Kat: If we can write an Application Profile for Andra's Wikidata Validation Logging use case, we can share the AP with the Profiles Ontology group.
* Tom: we could write it more succinctly in ShEx.
* ... DCMI has been discussing modeling APs in ShEx.
* ... The idea is to have a constraint model based on DSP, express it in ShEx, and describe usage patterns along with ShEx schemas which validate them.

* Kat will take the lead on creating the AP for the Wikidata vaidation logging use case.
* ericP: I didn't see how it could be applied to some use case that I could then measure for success or failure. 
* Andra: what does it mean to ShEx if this goes to REC?
* Tom: what they're addressing is an unusual use case, i.e. that one profile is more specific than another.
* ... it doesn't address specialization AND restriction.
