# Comment on Profile Ontology

 * [Comments submitted by Tom, Kat, Eric, Andra](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dxwg-comments/2019Feb/0001.html) about the First Public Working Draft of [Profiles Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/).
 * Tom: last time I looked on the mailing list, the working group was endorsing our view that it is really a vocabulary (not an ontology).

 * ... One of the editors posted some quick comments and I posted some follow-up comments.
 * ... (meta) got good feedback on the comments.
