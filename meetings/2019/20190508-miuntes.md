* Tom: Drive discussion in application profiles that can be turned into shex as well as html documents for documentation. Nishad works on a yaml based backend workflow that gets converted to ShEx schemas and documentation

Nishad: Will put demo online next week.  Initial focus was on DCMI's DSP (2008) model, but based now on YAML.  Not trying to create a new format, but want to create format that people could use for authoring application profile.  DMD is popular in Japan - not as complex as ShEx, to express basic application profile.  Aligns with ShEx - need Google Chrome.  See https://imi.go.jp/goi/datamodel-about.

Eric: Wonders if Nishad could figure out whether DMD is a sub-set of ShEx, and whether emerging DC model likewise.

Can ShExY align with the yaml format used in the universal Wikibase bot?https://github.com/dcodings/Wikibase_Universal_Bot#the-data-model-file

Nishad: OWL too painful. CSV is a lower bar.  DMD has a lively community in Japan: see https://imi.go.jp/goi/dmd_spec and https://cl.ly/057c2b/DMD-v301-Diagram_v010.svg

Eric: So DSP allows you to define an application model (properties in shapes) while DMD does not; this is part like ShEx.  Singapore Framework and DMD provide a metadata framework to connect schemas to application descriptions.
