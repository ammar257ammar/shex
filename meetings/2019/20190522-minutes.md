## Wikimedia hackathon

* Tom: We had a shex table for a few hours in the main section. People dropped by, people sounded really interested. Focued on 2 use cases for book descriptions on wikidata. Example of Manga (static cartoon) that can be extended to Anime (video) that should be separate entities. We used a tool from Jeremie to extract a big shex schema of everything used to describe the items you point at, used as a rough draft for polishing the final schema. We took screenshots and created a 2" story and uploaded the video to Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR75KhEoRKg)

* Andra: [test version](https://wikidata-shex.wmflabs.org/wiki/Main_Page) ShEx is being integrated in Wikidata having its own namespace (`E`). Expecting support request from community like tutorials

* Dimitris: I sent mail about our response to the comments. Let's combine an announcement about Wikidata news with 2.1 announcement.
