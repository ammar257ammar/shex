## EXTENDS

 * Eric: Harold, Iovka, Jeremie, Labra and Eric met to discuss EXTENDS, wrote some test cases and seems that we have consensus. We still need to implement it, it is pretty close to what I implemented and all the tests I wrote are still valid.
 * Kat: ericP, when will EXTENDS be ready?
 * ericP: for the js impl, I just need to merge the extends branch back up into master and back out into the wikidata branch.
 * Dimitris: what if someone extends schema A and then schema A changes?
 * ericP: not really different from if changes in schema A break something that conformed to it.

## Co-chair

 * Dimitris: a co-chair would be great.
 * ericP: the CG interface offers a way to elect a co-chair; we can use that process
