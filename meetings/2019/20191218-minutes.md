Attendees: Nishad, ericP, Kat, Dimitris
Regrets:

### Community Updates
ericP: prototyping a way for programs to communicate their interoperability with one another using shex.
... shapes might be used differently by different people. Do they both read and write the same shape.
Andra: Can you integrate this with void headers?
ericP: When an application speaks to solid common calendar- it registers itself as using that footprint. 
... Footprint knows all shapes that are in the constellation of resources and they are validated on intake by shex that describes containers.
... posting rdf payload, header rel=route
Andra: https://www.openphactsfoundation.org/guidelines-for-exposing-data-as-rdf-in-open-phacts/ https://github.com/openphacts/Void-Editor2
... swat4ls void headers surfaced again.
... would be interesting to use void headers to capture those profiles.
... yummydata extension is using void headers.
... who did what in a data set and provide example queries and list example namespaces. 
... could be replaced with a shape expression. A. Gray & students made void editor.
... yummy data: https://yummydata.org/
ANdra: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MmrpEQ9O7xA6frNk6gceu_IbQrUiEYGI9vcQjDvTL9c/edit#heading=h.7xg3cywpkgfq
... extracting subgraphs from wikidata use cases
... i think we can use shex here.
... Extract all statements that conform to a shape.
... option to download slurped results.
... if we can capture what goes by in shexsimple- but we don't automatically pull it out of the data.
... or use json output, filter conforming, and then generate triples
ericP: what triples exist that i covered, what triples exist that i didn't cover.
... it is a reminder of the stuff we haven't covered.
Andra: few hours or does this require more information.
ericP: UI work
kat: do we have any documentation of slurpygraph?
Andra: not yet
ericP: I have something that does what you want right now.
... if you use the rawgit interface, 
ericP: go to [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/master/packages/shex-webapp/doc/shex-simple.html)
... .. run the (clinical observation)/(with birthdate) manifest entry
... .. go to [controls v] and validate
... .. change on success to \[matched graph]
... .. validate again, marvel at triples at bottom
... .. when done marveling (no hurry), add `<s> <p> <o> .` to the data.
... .. change on success to \[remaining graph] and validate again
... .. applaud the `<https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/master/packages/shex-webapp/examples/s> <https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/master/packages/shex-webapp/examples/p> <https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/master/packages/shex-webapp/examples/o>.` triple in the results.
ericP: Combine this with wikidata branch
... slurp mode sucks down neighborhood
... matched graph mode extracts from there the ones that were mentioned during valdiation
... difference would be triples that were in these neighborhoods but were not used in validation
Andra: in wikidata subsetting we want to find the graphs that are relevant for a specific use
... special branch for rdf subsetting?
ericP: has been merged back to master already.
Andra: Let's play with this and put some noates in DanBri

### Kat's trip to Ghent

kat: created three schemas for ...
... the tool was useful for achieving consens and all parties signed off on the product.

### Go ShEx parser

nishad: looking for a Go ShEx parser
ericP: https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/targets.md includes Go as an Antlr target
... alternative would be to parse in another language and just use the Go binding for JSON to read the ShExJ.
... what are your goals?
... transformation and other handy tools; no validation.
ericP: so you'd want to run the whole toolchain from go.
nishad: hard to build node.js implementation into a single executable
ericP: can use webpack or browserify
nishad: Go binaries are easy to build

## Webinars

Andra: what webinars should we do?
... Nishad, I think you mentioned @@1.
... should we start with the Primer?
Nishad: if you have nothing ready, let's start with the primer.
