## Introductions

Daniel: Work with Jose Labra.  Here to help with use of my tool.

## Community Updates

Tom: Karen and I will give a talk at SWIB about application profiles. Will output ShEx.

Eric: Convert FHIR/JSON into FHIR/RDF - FHIR comes in three flavors: JSON, RDF, and XML. Because of JSON-LD being context-sensitive (same property, nested differently) - can use contexts to convert.  Using ShEx as a tool for generating JSON-LD contexts.  Will be somewhat application-specific, but some aspects will be general.

Andra: Quick-statement-like interface (as an example for something that would work for the community).

Paul: Tried to use QuickStatements.  Could start from the Entity Schema, then generate a table that QuickStatements would directly accept.  Quick Statements make assumptions about what you enter there.  If something starts with Q, assumes it will be an item.  Thus problems with Quick Statements in federation context.  

Andra: This use case is exactly the one that.  

Andra: Extracting expressions based on data, starting with Jeremie's tool, then identify the different schemas apparent on Wikidata.  Daniel helped me with ShExer tool yesterday.  Shexer looks promising. Get everything, then decide whether to stick with both or merge. Trying to figure out how to extract.  In PyShEx, can give simple expression - in effect, using expression as query pattern to extract just that ("data cutter").

Eric: I updated ShEx Simple to give you triples used in validation - then show you all remaining triples.  Have not dared to merge back into Wikidata branch.

Andra: What I call "data cutter" is like what you describe.

Paul: Done basic template, using on project page - want to link with Eric's tool.  Feeding a manifest, query fragment, so you can see compliance. Promising for getting more people engaged.  Integrates into workflow of different projects.  They define some loose form of entity schema and hope that people work towards that, so linking to tools would help people use it.  Once you integrate with templating language of MediaWiki, can see entry point earlier.  "Schema thru properties" - list properties.  Generate "depth-zero" ("linear") schema. See WikiprojectShex page - see https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Template:ShEx2 used on https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Schemas/Tutorial .  Wikiproject leaders have problems explaining too, so wikitext Templates can help them explain their expectations, and further produce tooling or input to tools.

Andra: Re-coin - if you have it installed, will tell you the type of properties to expect on that item.  If you use plugin, will say how close.  Look at other instances of the same class.

Daniel: Tools we are developing feed those [scenarios].  Templates to make things as accessible as possible.

Andra: Challenge with ShEx: extract data from Wikidata, "zero-depth" ShEx.  Re-coin could be a good topic starter.  If we would mine those re-coin rules.

Paul: Transform Recoin so you have [], then transform to ShEx.

Andra: Big fan of ShExer - Daniel, lets look at Recoin.

Kat: Eric and I met yesterday with colleagues in computer forensics.  Interested in schema extraction tools.  Looking for Python to integrate into tool chain.  ShExer?

Daniel: Actual features are backed by Python - ping me.

Issues
Github: https://github.com/shexSpec/shex/issues/97

Andra to create Google calendar? Announce on Wikiproject ShEx?

Eric: Put list of dates on shex.io.  ShExspec README and Project page should all point to one place.  Encourage, but not require, people to join the CG.

ACTION: Eric and Andra to sort out where to put schedule information (and messaging around it).

Phabricator: Investigate Shape Expressions for GLAMs: 
https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T227079
* Painting, libraries, museums - could list schemas there

Paul: Will make comments there to move it forward.

Eric: Meta-comment: We need some WD-specific stuff that will go into Wiki area, then we need general documentation.  So Daniel, as WD contributor, would you rather write into the wiki space?  How do we decide how much effort to put into WD as opposed to generic tooling?

Andra: First address issues, get some issue going.

https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/view/3356/ - This is not something we can fix.  Here: engaging with the developers.

https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T234856 - Localize shex-simple tool.  Can we say anything about this?

Eric: Write the tooling to make the [xxx] for localization.  This is doable.

ACTION: Tom and Andra to re-generate 
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/EntitySchema:E11
from tabular format.
