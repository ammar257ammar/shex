## Community Updates

* Andra: WDSlurp, working with Eric to use WDSlurp on the Virtuoso endpoint with Wikidata data. New problem with a schema involving references.
* ericP: I reproduced it in my environment. If you have shapes with nested asterixes it tries all kinds of thigs to satisfy.
* Andra: E37 human gene has recursion.
* ericP: Could be recursion. Are there any places where there are triple constraints that have cardinality inside another constraint with arbitrary max cardinality.
* Andra: Nice to be able to use existing schemas.
* ericP: I need to spend quality time with the debugger.
* Andra: Schemas are part of WMDE development plan for 2022. Internal workshops to get everyone up to speed with ShEx. Lydia is confiedent she can drive the discussion. If we have input it would be welcome. Will statements be allowed to point to entity schemas.
* ericP: Having statement be able to say I want to conform to this schema.
* Andra: Some consider schemas to police the community. Others belive multiple schemas can related to an item. 
* ericP: One piece of tooling that would be nice would be to have the query map as its own field in the schema. I will run this test on all these items and I only want to hear about the failures. Could be cool to have long-running validation where entities keep track of the last time they were validated to a specific schema.
