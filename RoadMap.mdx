# RoadMap
- ***EXTENDS*** - builds networks of reusable shapes.

- **Error reporting** - unify error reporting between implementations; spec and test to the extent possible.

  This doesn't prescribe what error messages are, just how to report them. For example, Whether
  ```{ <n1> <p1> 1 }@{ <p1> xsd:float }```
  reports the wrong dt for `<p1>` or a missing float and unexpected int is implementation-dependent.
  - **ShExPath** - captures the validation context of a violation. For instance, validating Peron's vehicles as automobiles might result in
  
  ```{"path": "<person1>@<#PersonShape>/<hasVehicle>%<bicycle2>@<#CarShape>",
  "error": "missing <engineNumber> property"}```

- ***API***
  - [current spec](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/API)
    - ***status***: draft
  - ***invocation*** of validators
  - ***EXTERN shape resolution*** via invocation API.
